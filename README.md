# Tokyo Night for ZenBrowser
Using [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme)'s Color Palette, this is my customization for Tokyo Night.
In the meantime, and since it's currently for personal use, it only has the main themeâ€”no Storm nor Light.

Installation requires you to have toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets enabled in your About:Config.
Reference Zen Browser's [Documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing).
